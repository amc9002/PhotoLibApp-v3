# PhotoLib – Project TODO

This document tracks planned work, ideas, and architectural notes.
It is intentionally incomplete and evolves with the project.

---

## Backend – Core API

### Photos

- [x] Separate photo metadata from file endpoints
- [x] Store originals and thumbnails separately
- [x] Add thumbnail endpoint
- [ ] Decide on delete strategy (soft vs hard)
- [ ] Implement soft delete logic (IsDeleted)
- [ ] Handle file cleanup on hard delete (if used)
- [ ] Add metadata-only GET /photo/{id}
- [ ] Add PUT /photo/{id} for updating title & description

### Galleries

- [ ] Review GalleryController endpoints
- [ ] Decide gallery delete behavior
- [ ] Add gallery-level sync support

---

## Backend – Storage & Architecture

- [x] File-based storage for originals and thumbnails
- [ ] Extract file path logic into helper/service
- [ ] Consider future cloud storage abstraction
- [ ] Add remarks/docs for storage evolution

---

## Frontend – Angular (Core)

- [ ] Align gallery view with thumbnail-only API
- [ ] Lazy-load thumbnails
- [ ] Fetch original image only on user interaction
- [ ] Offline-first sync UI states
- [ ] Centralize photo viewer state (active photo, mode, fullscreen)

---

## Sync & Offline

- [x] Two-ID model (localId / serverId)
- [ ] Soft delete propagation
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy
- [ ] Retry logic for file upload

---

## Frontend – Gallery & Photo Viewing

- [x] Gallery grid view (masonry / quilt-style layout)
- [x] Photo viewer mode (single photo focus)
- [x] Next / previous navigation
- [x] Thumbnail carousel in viewer mode
- [ ] Empty gallery state (no photos yet)

### Edit Photo Metadata UX

- [ ] Disable Save button until title or description is changed
- [ ] Detect dirty state by comparing initial vs current values
- [ ] Show subtle visual hint when form has unsaved changes

### Viewer Modes

- [ ] Standard viewer mode (utility-focused, current default)
- [ ] Presentation / postcard viewer mode
  - [ ] Layout: photo on the left
  - [ ] Title below the photo
  - [ ] Description on the right
  - [ ] Visually elegant, non-utility look (illustration / postcard feel)
- [ ] Toggle button to switch between viewer modes
- [ ] Remember last used viewer mode per session

### Fullscreen

- [ ] Fullscreen photo viewing mode
- [ ] Toggle fullscreen on/off from viewer controls
- [ ] Hide non-essential UI in fullscreen mode
- [ ] Restore previous viewer mode after exiting fullscreen

---

## Frontend – Gallery Presentation & Sharing

- [x] Gallery grid view (masonry / quilt-style layout)
- [ ] Gallery view as photo album (album-like presentation mode)
- [ ] Allow creating virtual photo albums from selected photos
- [ ] Allow sharing:
  - [ ] individual photos
  - [ ] photo albums
- [ ] Define album as a virtual collection (not a physical gallery)

---

## Social / Collaboration (Future)

- [ ] Share photos between users (read-only)
- [ ] Share photo albums between users
- [ ] Define access levels (owner / viewer)

---

## Media Types – Future Vision

- [ ] Support short video clips inside galleries (inspired by Harry Potter moving photos)
- [ ] Define unified media model (photo / video)

---

## AI / Neural Features – Long Term

- [ ] Photo animation using neural networks
- [ ] Define AI-generated media as derived content (not original)

---

## Ideas / Notes

- Cloud storage support (Blob / S3) – future version
- Multiple thumbnail sizes
- EXIF parsing on backend
- Distinct UI modes:
  - Gallery overview (grid / masonry)
  - Photo viewer (utility-focused)
  - Photo presentation / postcard mode
  - Fullscreen viewer
  - Overlay windows (properties, full-size)
- Consider enforcing gallery creation only together with first photo upload
